# Hi there, I'm OnlyTense ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

> Hello, I am an aviation enthusiast who loves to code, especially discord bots! I mainly use JS although I am currently learning HTML. My DMs on Discord are currently off (OnlyTense#2485) but you can either spot me in the [MSFS Official Server](https://discord.gg/msfs) or [my server](https://discord.gg/NbxUk4TsnV)! Happy coding :)

```js
const onlytense = require('school.js')
```
```js
let onlytense = dude addicted to flight-simming;
```
